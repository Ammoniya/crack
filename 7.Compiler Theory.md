# Compiler Theory

## What is a compiler?
A compiler is a computer program that transforms a source language (high-level language (HLL)) into a machine language (low-level language (LLL)) without changing the program meaning. It is an intermediary between the machine-readable language and the human-readable language. The principles of compiler design gives an overview of the translation and optimization processes.

## Type of Compilers
* Source-to-source compiler: This is a compiler in which the source code of one language is transformed into a source code of a different language. Examples include CoffeeScript and Haxe.
* Cross compiler: In this compiler, the source code can be produced in one machine and executed in a different machine. GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is a good example of a cross compiler.
* JIT (just in time) compiler: In this compiler, the compilation is deferred until the runtime. It is applied to modern programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript.
* Hardware compiler: This is a compiler that uses the hardware configuration to produce output, rather than a string of instructions. Xilinx Synthesis Tool (XST) is a good example of a hardware compiler.

## The compiler design architecture
The compiler design architecture can be divided into two main parts: analysis and synthesis

### Analysis
This part represents the front-end in compiler design. It consists of various operations such as analyzing the source code, dividing the core into sections, and checking for errors. It also constructs a symbol table to map source code symbols to relating information such as type, scope, and location.

An intermediate representation (IR) of the program is generated and analyzed before it is sent to the synthesis phase. The analysis part of the architecture consists of phases such as preprocessing, lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis.

### Synthesis

This part uses the intermediate code representation as the input. It represents the back-end in compiler design. The synthesis part of the architecture utilizes the symbol table and the intermediate code representation to produce the target program. It consists of phases such as optimization and code generation.

## Tools we can designs compilers.
* GCC (oldest)
* LLVM

## What is LLVM? 

LLVM is a collection of compiler and toolchain technologies that used to create a front end for any programming language and a back end for many instruction set architectures.

## What is GCC?
The GNU Compiler Collection is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project supporting various programming languages, hardware architectures and operating systems. The Free Software Foundation distributes GCC as free software under the GNU General Public License.

## Difference between gcc and llvm

GCC supports more traditional languages than Clang and LLVM, such as Ada, Fortran, and Go. GCC supports more less-popular architectures, and supported RISC-V earlier than Clang and LLVM. GCC supports more language extensions and more assembly language features than Clang and LLVM.

## Different type of c compilers
* Borland Turbo C
* Tiny C Compiler
* Portable C Compiler
* GCC
* Clang

### What is the best compiler for c language?
* If you want extreme portability - and will ship C that needs to compile on just about any Unix/Linux box - gcc is the “default” go-to standard.
gcc also has numerous cross-compilers for many processors used in embedded and small devices, so it’s also popular there.
* If you’re a developer using Linux, the “new kid on the block” as far as open-source C compilers is LLVM’s “clang” compiler.
clang also runs on Windows (as does gcc, although it’s less popular there than Linux).
* If you’re a Windows developer, the Microsoft VC++ compilers (which compile C as well as C++) are available and good.
* If you’re willing to open your wallet, the Intel C++ Compilers - which also compile C - are excellent.

Lol use Clang or GCC

## Cache Mapping | Cache Mapping Techniques

* Cache mapping defines how a block from the main memory is mapped to the cache memory in case of a cache miss.
* Cache mapping is a technique by which the contents of main memory are brought into the cache memory.

![Cache-Mapping-Diagram-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20130001/156889530-00bc42b2-1c6a-404e-9a57-efec10aaa3af.png)

### Note
* Main memory is divided into equal size partitions called as blocks or frames.
* Cache memory is divided into partitions having same size as that of blocks called as lines.
* During cache mapping, block of main memory is simply copied to the cache and the block is not actually brought from the main memory.

### Cache Mapping Techniques
1. Direct Mapping
2. Fully Associative Mapping
3. K-way Set Associative Mapping

#### 1. Direct Mapping
In direct mapping,
* A particular block of main memory can map only to a particular line of the cache.
* The line number of cache to which a particular block can map is given by-
  Cache line number = ( Main Memory Block Address ) Modulo (Number of lines in Cache)
* In direct mapping,
  * There is no need of any replacement algorithm.
  * This is because a main memory block can map only to a particular line of the cache.
  * Thus, the new incoming block will always replace the existing block (if any) in that particular line.
  
#### 2. Fully Associative Mapping

In fully associative mapping,

* A block of main memory can map to any line of the cache that is freely available at that moment.
* This makes fully associative mapping more flexible than direct mapping.
* Here,
  * All the lines of cache are freely available.
  * Thus, any block of main memory can map to any line of the cache.
  * Had all the cache lines been occupied, then one of the existing blocks will have to be replaced.
* In fully associative mapping,
* A replacement algorithm is required.
  * Replacement algorithm suggests the block to be replaced if all the cache lines are occupied.
  * Thus, replacement algorithm like FCFS Algorithm, LRU Algorithm etc is employed.
